## Overview

> The 2021 Codebreaker Challenge consists of a series of tasks that are worth a varying amount of points based upon their difficulty. Schools will be ranked according to the total number of points accumulated by their students. Solutions may be submitted at any time for the duration of the Challenge.
>
> While not required, we recommend that you solve tasks in order, since they flow with the storyline. Later tasks may rely on artifacts / inputs from earlier tasks.
>
> Each task in this year's challenge will require a range of skills. We need you to call upon all of your technical expertise, your intuition, and your common sense.
>
> Good luck. We hope you enjoy the challenge!

> The Internet is home to many different cyber actors. To better prepare for and defend against these actors, NSA routinely investigates foreign cyber actors and their activities. During one such investigation, a new IP address was identified to be part of an unknown actor's infrastructure. NSA believes it is a [listening post](https://wiki.cbc.cybersecurity.nmt.edu/doku.php?id=listeningpost) (LP).
